### Case Introduction
The vast majority of lyrics and music used in Rachael and Eliza Hurwitz YouTube video, titled [_It's Finally Ironic_ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32LCwZFoKio), are directly taken from Alanis Morissette's track, [_Ironic_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jne9t8sHpUc), released in 1995. _Ironic_ was an immensely popular song across the world and nominated for two Grammy's. Rachael and Eliza's video was produced over a decade later and aimed to be a humorous version of the original song. Though similar videos have been removed from YouTube for copyright infringement, I will argue for the legality of this video based on fair use. 
 
 
######  __Fair Use__ can be defined as:
 "[a copyright principle based on the belief that the public is entitled to freely use portions of copyrighted materials for purposes of commentary and criticism](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/)." Fair Use is upheld by four elements. These [factors are](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/):
 * the purpose and character of your use
 * the nature of the copyrighted work
 * the amount and substantiality of the portion taken, and
 * the effect of the use upon the potential market.
 
I will thoroughly examine each element of fair use in order to argue the authenticity and originality of Rachael and Eliza's work. 
 
### Factor 1: Character
The nature of _It's Finally Ironic_ is an obvious example of __parody__.  Parody can be [defined as](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parody) "a piece of writing, music, etc., that imitates the style of someone or something else in an amusing way".  _It's finally Ironic_ imitates both the lyrics and music of its original but in a humorous way. 

In regards to lyrics, all of the anecdotes presented in Alanis Morissette's song _Ironic_  are implied to be ironic. _However_ Rachael and Eliza Hurwitz, disagree with this implication. Instead in their video, Rachael and Eliza use Alanis Morissette’s examples and make them literal cases of irony. This is accomplished by adding lyrics to the original song. An example would be: (provide example). 

In regards to style, the parody video is mocking the original music video. The films styles are very similar and both videos take place entirely in a car.  However, the use of props and expressions throughout the parody provide humor. In the original video, Alanis Morissette is seen eating chips, a common car ride snack, in the backseat throughout the film. Alternatively, the parody video has Ms. Hurwitz in the backseat eating an entire loaf of French bread. The French breach is used specifically as a microphone at time 2:20. This action is accompanied by exaggerated expressions and a full mouth of bread.  The use of this prop appears to be over exaggerated and ridiculous, which successfully pokes fun at the original music video.  
 
### Factor 2: Nature
 
The original work was a published piece. _Ironic_ was released in 1995 and the parody video was not released until 2013.  (add a lot more here)
 
### Factor 3: Amount Taken
Though the amount of original content used is significant, fair use has exceptions for parody cases. As quoted: (A parodist is permitted to borrow quite a bit, even the heart of the original work, in order to conjure up the original work.)[ http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/] . Therefore, _It's Finally Ironic_ has the right to use a large portion of the original track. It is critical that the audience recognize the original piece in order to have the comedic effect. 
Additionally, though a significant amount of the original content is used, lyrics are changed from the original consistently throughout the song. A comparison of the first stanza in each song  clearly highlights significant differences:
|Original Lyrics|Parody Lyrics|
|:---:|:---:|
|An old man turned ninety-eight| An old man turned 98
He won the lottery and died the next day| He won the lottery, and died the next day, from a sever paper cut from his lottery ticket
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay| It's a black fly in your chardonnay that was specifically purchased to repel black flies
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late|It's a death row pardon that causes your demise, because you leave the jail and get hit by a bus
Isn't it ironic, don't you think| And that really is ironic We fixed it for you, Alanis (you're welcome)


### Factor 4: Market Effects
I believe any effect on the market is either negligible or nonexistent. The parody video does not aim to destroy the original video’s market. The additional lyrics are amusing and awkward. The parody is not intended to replace or compete with its original.

 However, it is important to recall the nature of parody in regards to copyright. This example would still be protected under fair use if market value were decreased due to loss of respect.   The purpose of parody is to present an original work in a humorous way, therefore, there is a possibility for market loss. An example of this would be if Alanis Morissette's song _Ironic_ could never be taken seriously again and was no longer played on the radio. 
 
### Conclusion 

Rachael and Eliza Hurwitz YouTube video _It's Finally Ironic_ is a perfect example of parody. The film uses a significant portion of the original for its audience to recognize the original song and appreciate the comedic changes. In accordance to the four factors of fair use, it does not copyright infringement.
