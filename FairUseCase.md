### Case Introduction
The vast majority of lyrics and music used in Rachael and Eliza Hurwitz YouTube video, titled [_It's Finally Ironic_ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32LCwZFoKio), are directly taken from Alanis Morissette's track, [_Ironic_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jne9t8sHpUc), released in 1995. _Ironic_ was an immensely popular song across the world and nominated for two Grammy's. Rachael and Eliza's video was produced over a decade later and aimed to be a humorous version of the original song. Though similar videos have been removed from YouTube for copyright infringement, the legality of this video is argued in the following paragraphs based on fair use. 
 
 
####  __Fair Use__ can be defined as:
 "[a copyright principle based on the belief that the public is entitled to freely use portions of copyrighted materials for purposes of commentary and criticism](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/)." Fair Use is upheld by four elements. These [factors are](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/):
 * the purpose and character of your use
 * the nature of the copyrighted work
 * the amount and substantiality of the portion taken, and
 * the effect of the use upon the potential market.
 
Each element of fair use is thoroughly examined below in order to argue the authenticity and originality of Rachael and Eliza's work. 
 
### Factor 1: Character
The nature of _It's Finally Ironic_ is an obvious example of __parody__.  Parody can be [defined as](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parody) "a piece of writing, music, etc., that imitates the style of someone or something else in an amusing way".  _It's finally Ironic_ imitates both the lyrics and music of its original in a humorous way. 

In regards to lyrics, Rachael and Eliza Hurwitz, disagree with the implication that Alanis Morissette’s examples of irony are indeed _ironic_. Instead in their video, Rachael and Eliza use Alanis Morissette’s lyrics and make them literal cases of irony.  An example is: 

|Original Lyrics|Parody Lyrics|
|:---:|:---:|
|"It's like rain on your wedding day."|"It's like rain on your wedding day. A day and place, you chose because it's known not to rain."|


In regards to style, the parody mocks the original music video. The films' styles are similar with both videos taking place entirely in a car.  However, the use of props and expressions throughout the parody provide humor. In the original video, Alanis Morissette is seen eating chips, a common car ride snack. Alternatively, the parody video has Ms. Hurwitz in the backseat eating an entire loaf of French bread. The bread is used specifically as a microphone at time 2:20. This action is accompanied by exaggerated expressions and a mouth full of bread. The use of this prop is excessive and ridiculous, which successfully casts the original music video in a humorous way.  
 
### Factor 2: Nature
 
_Ironic_  was a published in 1995 and the parody video was not released until 2013. Over a decade passed between the two videos, therefore, Alanis Morissett had a significant amount of time to benefit from the song and following albums without any impact from Hurwitz's parody video. It is important to mention that both videos are for commercial use. The parody on YouTube has a link to the artists' webpage where the "single" is being sold. However, the purpose and nature of these videos are fundamentally different. Alanis Morissette is a successful artist who takes her music seriously. The Hurwitz sisters are aspiring comedians. They are not attempting to make a hit single, instead they are attempting to make their audience laugh. Throughout the song, they even credit Alanis Morissette by explicitly staying, _"We fixed it for you Alanis"_. The Hurwitz sisters are not trying to take credit for the original song or melody. 

### Factor 3: Amount Taken
Though the amount of original content used is significant, fair use has exceptions for parody cases. As quoted: [A parodist is permitted to borrow quite a bit, even the heart of the original work, in order to conjure up the original work.]( http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/) . Therefore, _It's Finally Ironic_ has the right to use a large portion of the original track. It is critical that the audience recognize the original piece in order to have the comedic effect. 

Additionally, though a significant amount of original content is used, lyrics are added throughout the song. Below, a comparison of the first stanza clearly highlights significant differences. These differences considerably change the original song. 

|Original Lyrics|Parody Lyrics|
|:---:|:---:|
|"An old man turned ninety-eight. He won the lottery and died the next day"| "An old man turned 98. He won the lottery, and died the next day, from a sever paper cut from his lottery ticket."|
|"It's a black fly in your Chardonnay"| "It's a black fly in your chardonnay that was specifically purchased to repel black flies"|
|"Isn't it ironic, don't you think"| "And that really is ironic. We fixed it for you, Alanis (you're welcome)"|


### Factor 4: Market Effects
It is believed any effect on the market is negligible or nonexistent. The parody video does not aim to destroy the original video’s market. The additional lyrics are amusing and often do not rhyme or match the original beat. The parody is not intended to replace or directly compete with its original.

However, it is important to recall the nature of parody in regards to copyright. This example is still be protected under fair use if market value were decreased due to loss of respect.   With all parodies, there is a possibility for market loss of the original work. An example is if Alanis Morissette's song could never be taken seriously again and was no longer played on the radio. In this unlikely event, the parody is still be protected by fair use. 
 
### Conclusion 

Rachael and Eliza Hurwitz YouTube video _It's Finally Ironic_ is a perfect example of parody. The film uses a significant portion of the original for its audience to recognize the original song and appreciate the comedic changes. In accordance to the four factors of fair use, it is not considered copyright infringement.
